3. I received an Email shortly after applying from a Kimberly Jeremiah (kimberly.jeremiah55@mailscop.us) stating they had two openings one for day shift (9AM - 3PM) and one for night shift (3PM - 9PM).
 3.1 I replied stating I would like the day shift if possible. 

 3.2 The person quickly replied and asked me to follow a link to fill in information to obtain a Background Check / Credit Score report.


4. I was already suspicious from the Job Poster having 0 connections and the email associated with the initial contact.

 4.2 From there I proceeded to dig into the link provided and further check the email addresses. 

 4.3 The URL shown was " www.iCheckmyScores[.]com ", but upon hovering over the link it showed a URL of "starpacks[.]live"

 4.4 I tested the URL in the Browserling Sandbox which showed a blank page
