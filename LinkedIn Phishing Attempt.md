4. I was already suspicious from the Job Poster having 0 connections and the email associated with the initial contact. 
 4.1 I became hyperly suspicious upon receiving the second message. 

 4.2 From there I proceeded to dig into the link provided and further check the email addresses. 

 4.3 The URL shown was " www.iCheckmyScores[.]com ", but upon hovering over the link it showed a URL of "starpacks[.]live"

 4.4 I tested the URL in the Browserling Sandbox which showed a blank page
